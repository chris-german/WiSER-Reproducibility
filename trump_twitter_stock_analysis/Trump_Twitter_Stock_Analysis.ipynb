The Democrat Mayor and of courses Governor Cuomo have no idea what to do. New York State is a mess - No Money High Taxes &amp;amp; Crime Everyone Fleeing. November 3rd. We can fix it! https://t.co/xI1wDz9qh5 https://t.co/rQ8Sl8iBwN Heading to North Carolina. See you soon! Just left Florida see everyone tonight in North Carolina! #MAGA https://t.co/pf2feOSYX7 https://t.co/jjBLPzKSbY Thank you Jupiter Florida! https://t.co/B4vcal8lOF https://t.co/M9KcwFEYA7 https://t.co/iwk7CsnoxI Democrats and Sleepy Joe’s Peaceful Protestors! https://t.co/weQBW7xKic Sleepy Joe Biden has pledged to ABOLISH Suburban Communites as they currently exist by reinstating Obama’s radical AFFH Regulation. There goes Suburbia! Democrats admit that President Trump’s message is “working” on violence coming to the Suburbs in a Looney Biden Administration. Plus Biden just doubled down on forcing Federal control of local zoning. This means low income housing and projects. So much for the American Dream! https://t.co/GYa5c9mjxs On my way to the Great State of Florida see you soon! https://t.co/6Yu6lHhX7f They are not “peaceful protesters” as Sleepy Joe and the Democrats call them they are THUGS - And it is all taking place in Democrat run cities. Call me and request Federal HELP. We will solve your problems in a matter of minutes - And thanks to the U.S. Marshalls in Portland! ....Like I did in the 2016 Primaries if more money is needed which I doubt it will be I will put it up! Because of the China Virus my Campaign which has raised a lot of money was forced to spend in order to counter the Fake News reporting about the way we handled it (China Ban etc.). We did and are doing a GREAT job and have a lot of money left over much more than 2016.... Suburban voters are pouring into the Republican Party because of the violence in Democrat run cities and states. If Biden gets in this violence is “coming to the Suburbs” and FAST. You could say goodbye to your American Dream! My Campaign spent a lot of money up front in order to compensate for the false reporting and Fake News concerning our handling of the China Virus. Now they see the GREAT job we have done and we have 3 times more than we had 4 years ago - &amp;amp; are up in polls. Lots of $’s &amp;amp; ENERGY! The Democrats will open up their states on November 4th the day after the Election. These shutdowns are ridiculous and only being done to hurt the economy prior to the most important election perhaps in our history! #MAGA The wonderful Charles Payne @cvpayne of @FoxNews just wrote a great and inspirational new book UNSTOPPABLE PROSPERITY. Get it NOW. So many important thoughts and suggestions on investing and “Making Money”. Also Charles just happens to be a Great Guy! New York City must stop the Shutdown now. The Governor &amp;amp; Mayor are destroying the place! True! https://t.co/6Fgh8rUlMU Based on their bad ratings so would many! https://t.co/0FS6xc2IP5 Great! Biden is finally being forced out of his basement. Now you’ll be able to see what is going on “up there”. He may do some “limited” campaigning. Basement Biden is no longer playing well in the Polls! If Biden’s Polling wasn’t going down and fast he wouldn’t be going to Pittsburgh. Fredo’s got a convicted lier for a lawyer who may be going back to jail for an even longer time - additional lies to Congress. Many more tapes of him with Fredo and other media scum reporters. Reveals how deranged &amp;amp; sick they all are! https://t.co/g3aBQZ5VJv Why does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230 immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you! @HawleyMO @MarshaBlackburn https://t.co/ah0nMeQdM0 Thank you Natalie! https://t.co/YVCZqo256D Thank you! https://t.co/HXton857CF Same guy that didn’t want to take off his mask yesterday in asking a question while being very socially distanced.

Great pitcher!!! https://t.co/pMq197KahK ....And because of weak and pathetic Democrat leadership this thuggery is happening in other Democrat run cities and states. Must shut them down fast. Biden and his most Liberal in Senate running mate Kamala won’t even talk about it. They won’t utter the words LAW &amp;amp; ORDER! BLM Protesters horribly harass elderly Pittsburgh diners scaring them with loud taunts while taking their food right off their plate. These Anarchists not protesters are Biden voters but he has no control and nothing to say. Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs! The Real Polls are starting to look GREAT! We will be having an even bigger victory than that of 2016. The Radical Left Anarchists Agitators Looters and just plain Lunatics will not be happy but they will behave! This guy is given the answer to questions which he reads from his teleprompter. Is Donna  involved in this scam? Could you imagine if I got caught doing this. The media will never report this scam (FAKE) candidate. Sad! https://t.co/ywvgsZAmEd Winners All! https://t.co/2R5qutk0W8 Congratulations Erica.

Just more corrupt Fake News trying to change the course of our most important ever Election! Biggest &amp;amp; Fastest Financial Recovery In History. Next year will be BEST EVER unless a very Sleepy person becomes President and massively raises your taxes - In which case CRASH! Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed “love letters from Kim Jong Un” as though I viewed them as just that. Obviously was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk! Biggest and Fastest Financial Recovery In History. Next year will be the best ever unless a Sleepy person who wants to massively raise your taxes gets in. I’m which case CRASH!!! Rochester N.Y. Brooklyn N.Y. Portland - All had bad nights all weakly run by Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors! Get the picture? 10.6 Million Jobs Created In Just 4 Months A Record!!! Biden Underperforming! @OANN What else is new the story of his life. Gordon Chang: China Seems ‘to Be Favoring Joe Biden‘ in Presidential Election https://t.co/LmXVsqOJzP via @BreitbartNews. Of course they want Biden. I have taken $Billions from China and given it to our Farmers and U.S. Treasury. China would own the U.S. if Biden &amp;amp; Hunter got in! Will be having a Labor Day News Conference today at the White House 1:00 P.M. Jobs number and the Economic comeback are looking GREAT. Happy Labor Day! Starting to get VERY high marks in our handling of the Coronavirus (China Virus) especially when compared to other countries and areas of the world. Now the Vaccines (Plus) are coming and fast! A so-called peaceful protest! https://t.co/RYchH5x5cS Thank you! https://t.co/IFOflRdk4q A massive Disinformation Campaign is going on by the Democrats their partner the Fake News Media &amp;amp; Big Tech. They create false stories and then push them like has never been done before even beyond the 2016 Campaign. It imperils our Country and must stop now. Victory 2020! https://t.co/M6kPbwcyQw https://t.co/h78XwnW5dM https://t.co/PNqAvoGReK Our Economy and Jobs are doing really well. Next Year will be a Record Setter. Stay Tuned!

Sick! https://t.co/8NpRepi8UY Big Ten Football is looking really good but may lose Michigan Illinois and Maryland because of those Governors’ ridiculous lack of interest or political support. They will play without them? The Democrats together with the corrupt Fake News Media have launched a massive Disinformation Campaign the likes of which has never been seen before. They will say anything like their recent lies about me and the Military and hope that it sticks... But #MAGA gets it! Department of Education is looking at this. If so they will not be funded! https://t.co/dHsw6Y6Y3M The Democrats know that they are creating havoc on Election night. This is what they want. WE WILL WIN! https://t.co/BkPYHwsRTr Steve Jobs would not be happy that his wife is wasting  money he left her on a failing Radical Left Magazine that is run by a con man (Goldberg) and spews FAKE NEWS &amp;amp; HATE. Call her write her let her know how you feel!!! https://t.co/wwuoP85bQE ....fix it and fast. The current recipient has no chance and won’t even try. As I have often said Baltimore is last in everything WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE! Kimberly is fully Endorsed by me something I do not do lightly. Take advantage of it and MAKE BALTIMORE GREAT! Be smart Baltimore! You have been ripped off for years by the Democrats &amp;amp; gotten nothing but poverty &amp;amp; crime. It will only get worse UNLESS YOU ELECT KIMBERLY KLACIK TO CONGRESS. She brings with her the power &amp;amp; ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. She works sooo hard.... ....Baltimore will turn around and I will help. Crime will go way down money and jobs will pour in. Life will be MUCH better because Kimberly really cares. The Dems have had 100 years and they gave you nothing but heartache. Baltimore is the WORST IN NATION Kimberly will.. https://t.co/OzYzLQ2FQp https://t.co/QO66XieSfR https://t.co/7NVLPL1cRF https://t.co/coUG9tPUCi https://t.co/xD8iKKVHLg Wish I could join you but totally focused on November 3rd.

Nancy Pelosi said she got “set up” by the owner (a very good one) of a beauty parlor. If so how will she do in negotiations against President Xi of China President Putin of Russia or Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Not so well I suspect but far better than Joe Hiden’ would do! Thank you! https://t.co/TgVkWA7irF https://t.co/P8bokc3wEU Great job @PeteHegseth one of a kind! @foxandfriends Not any more! https://t.co/7Z2wxA6K13 ....This reminds me of the Dirty Dossier which was pushed hard by John McCain &amp;amp; then with a thud turned out to be a total fraud. So many other scams also. The Radical Far Left is VICIOUS they will do or say anything to win. But they won’t we will WIN &amp;amp; have four great years! You work so hard for the military from completely rebuilding a depleted mess that was left by OBiden to fixing a broken V.A. and fighting for large scale military pay raises and then a slimeball reporter maybe working with disgruntled people makes up such a horrible charge.. Letters from so many coaches athletes and others pushed hard for this. I agree has done so much for so many! https://t.co/XTSFEoxyAM Trump Orders Purge of ‘Critical Race Theory‘ from Federal Agencies https://t.co/ygXcTXRHsQ via @BreitbartNews  This is a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue.

The Atlantic Magazine is dying like most magazines so they make up a fake story in order to gain some relevance. Story already refuted but this is what we are up against. Just like the Fake Dossier. You fight and and fight and then people realize it was a total fraud! Great Jobs Numbers! 1.37 Million Jobs Added In August. Unemployment Rate Falls To 8.4% (Wow much better than expected!).

They were protesting the “country’s worsening economic situation and inflation”... Nancy Pelosi says she got “set up” by a Beauty Parlor owner. Maybe the Beauty Parlor owner should be running the House of Representatives instead of Crazy Nancy? Crazy Nancy Pelosi said she was “set up” by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn’t wear a MASK!). Does anyone want a Speaker of the House who can be so easily SET UP? Do you notice that any time Fake News Suppression Polls are put out like @FoxNews the Stock Market goes DOWN. We are going to WIN! .@FoxNews Polls are as in the past Fake News. They have been from the beginning way off in 2016. Get a new pollster. I believe we are leading BIG! Based on the massive number of Unsolicited &amp;amp; Solicited Ballots that will be sent to potential Voters for the upcoming 2020 Election &amp;amp; in order for you to MAKE SURE YOUR VOTE COUNTS &amp;amp; IS COUNTED SIGN &amp;amp; MAIL IN your Ballot as EARLY as possible. On Election Day or Early Voting.. .....go to your Polling Place to see whether or not your Mail In Vote has been Tabulated (Counted). If it has you will not be able to Vote &amp;amp; the Mail In System worked properly. If it has not been Counted VOTE (which is a citizen’s right to do).

GOD BLESS AMERICA!!! .@NYGovCuomo should get his puppet New York prosecutors who have been illegally after me and my family for years to investigate his incompetent handling of the China Virus and all of the deaths caused by this incompetence. It is at minimum a Nursing Home Scandal - 11000 DEAD! Sleepy Joe Hiden’ was acknowledged by his own people to have done a terrible job on a much easier situation H1N1 Swine Flu. The OBiden Administration failed badly on this &amp;amp; now he sits back in his basement and criticizes every move we make on the China Virus. DOING GREAT JOB! https://t.co/p2H40mD7Sh Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York has the worst record on death and China Virus. 11000 people alone died in Nursing Homes because of his incompetence!</td></tr><tr><th>4</th><td>2020-09-02</td><td>Thank you Michele! https://t.co/0Z7KzA9lb8 My Administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking Federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people burn buildings and ruin lives and businesses.

You are so lucky to have me as your President😉With Joe Hiden’ it would crash😧 THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA!https://t.co/LhqOINkZFS Can you believe what’s happening!? They give Joe Hiden’ the questions and he reads them an answer! https://t.co/ivMw6uQ2gp Will be landing shortly in the Great State of North Carolina. See you soon! When a Kennedy loses a Democrat Primary in Massachusetts by a lot it just shows how far LEFT that party has gone. Joe Hiden’ will never be able to hold them back. Life 2nd A Energy Religion Jobs and the Economy would be totally obliterated! Will soon be heading to Wilmington North Carolina and then will be going to Battleship North Carolina. Look forward to seeing all of my friends! 2016 was AMAZING but we never had this kind of ENTHUSIASM! We had FAR more people (many millions) watching us at the RNC than did Sleepy Joe and the DNC and yet an ad just ran saying the opposite. This is what we’re up against. Lies. But we will WIN! The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in on tape is a really big deal. She probably treats him like she treats everyone else...And she strongly supported a Kennedy who just lost in of all places Massachusetts! Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individual especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule! Crazy Nancy Pelosi is being decimated for having a beauty parlor opened when all others are closed and for not wearing a Mask - despite constantly lecturing everyone else. We will almost certainly take back the House and send Nancy packing! Seriously is this what our great USA wants as its leader? https://t.co/vgYqhuA4BV Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individulal especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule! Joe Biden is not on the side of Law Enforcement and that was spectacularly evident on my very successful trip yesterday to Kenosha. We solved the problem quickly and it was very much appreciated by the people of Wisconsin. Joe Biden wouldn’t know where to begin - a bad record! Rigged Election? https://t.co/LK0gp40luC The Unsolicited Ballots Scam is their only hope.

I send my condolences to his family and the people of India as they grieve the loss of a great leader. https://t.co/iZcL0U92pZ Had a very productive conversation with Kevin Warren Commissioner of the Big Ten Conference about immediately starting up Big Ten football. Would be good (great!) for everyone - Players Fans Country. On the one yard line! Heading to Kenosha Wisconsin to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard for a job well done. The Violence stopped six days ago the moment the Guard entered the picture. Thank you! It never ends! Now they are trying to say that your favorite President me went to Walter Reed Medical Center having suffered a series of mini-strokes. Never happened to THIS candidate - FAKE NEWS. Perhaps they are referring to another candidate from another Party! Good luck to Sean Compton a winner at everything he does! https://t.co/OIBJtxnudQ People are tired of watching the highly political @NBA.

Just watched what Biden had to say. To me he’s blaming the Police far more than he’s blaming the Rioters Anarchists Agitators and Looters which he could never blame or he would lose the Radical Left Bernie supports! LAW &amp;amp; ORDER! The Radical Left Mayors &amp;amp;  Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their “Movement”. It wasn’t supposed to be like this but the Anarchists &amp;amp; Agitators got carried away and don’t listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement! I’ve been getting really good polls some over 50% except for one Fake Poll done by @ABC NEWS which gives NO INFORMATION about the sample R or D or anything else. They did this last Election with one week to go down 12 points and I won. They are disgusting Fake News! Portland is a mess and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn’t clean it up we will go in and do it for them! If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha Wisconsin there would be no Kenosha right now. Also there would have been great death and injury. I want to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard. I will see you on Tuesday! Just had a wonderful conversation with my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan who will be leaving office soon. Shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan whose relationship with the USA is the best it has ever been. Special man! When is Slow Joe Biden going to criticize the Anarchists Thugs &amp;amp; Agitators in ANTIFA? When is he going to suggest bringing up the National Guard in BADLY RUN &amp;amp; Crime Infested Democrat Cities &amp;amp; States? Remember he can’t lose the Crazy Bernie Super Liberal vote! ....His problem is interesting. He must always be weak on CRIME because of the Bernie Sanders Radical Left voter. If he loses them like Crooked Hillary did he is “toast” and many will vote for me because of TRADE (Bernie was good on trade). Joe MUST always be weak on crime! Joe Biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice his poll numbers are PLUNGING! Going to Pittsburgh where I have helped industry to a record last year &amp;amp; then back to his  basement for an extended period... Rushing him out of basement after seeing some very disturbing numbers.

Wrong! Portland will never recover with a fool for a Mayor.... ....He tried mixing with the Agitators and Anarchists and they mocked him. He would like to blame me and the Federal Government for going in but he hasn’t seen anything yet. We have only been there with a small group to defend our U.S. Courthouse because he couldn’t do it.... ..The people of Portland like all other cities &amp;amp;  parts of our great Country want Law &amp;amp; Order. The Radical Left Democrat Mayors like the dummy running Portland or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime will never be able to do it!

Crooked &amp;amp; Incompetent! https://t.co/d4hZDAvdWo John Kasich did a bad job in Ohio ran for President and was easy to beat and now went to the other side desperate for relevance.

With that said a former DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE named Miles Taylor who I do not know (never heard of him) said he left &amp;amp; is on the open arms Fake News circuit. Said to be a real “stiff”. They will take anyone against us! The ObamaBiden Administration was the most corrupt in history including the fact that they got caught SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN the biggest political scandal in the history of our Country. It’s called Treason and more. Thanks for your very kind words Michelle! Looking back into history the response by the ObamaBiden team to the H1N1 Swine Flu was considered a weak and pathetic one. Check out the polling it’s really bad. The big difference is that they got a free pass from the Corrupt Fake News Media! ....My Administration and I built the greatest economy in history of any country turned it off saved millions of lives and now am building an even greater economy than it was before. Jobs are flowing NASDAQ is already at a record high the rest to follow. Sit back &amp;amp; watch! Somebody please explain to @MichelleObama that Donald J. Trump would not be here in the beautiful White House if it weren’t for the job done by your husband Barack Obama.

Really bad TV Ratings for Morning Joe (@JoeNBC). @foxandfriends doing great leading all others by far. @CNN not a factor!!! My visits last week to Texas and Frorida had massive numbers of cheering people gathered along the roads and highways thousands and thousands even bigger (by far) than the crowds of 2016. Saw no Biden supporters and yet some in the Fake News said it was an equal number. Sad! 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 50% in new Rasmussen Poll (higher than Obama at this point in time). Thank you! Cases up because of BIG Testing! Much of our Country is doing very well. Open the Schools! FAKE NEWS IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! With the exception of New York &amp;amp; a few other locations we’ve done MUCH better than most other Countries in dealing with the China Virus. Many of these countries are now having a major second wave. The Fake News is working overtime to make the USA (&amp;amp; me) look as bad as possible! In an illegal late night coup Nevada’s clubhouse Governor made it impossible for Republicans to win the state. Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation. Using Covid to steal the state. See you in Court! https://t.co/cNSPINgCY7 https://t.co/h5bAKu6Xws ....and ruined. The Federal Government must again seek the Death Penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial. Our Country cannot let the appellate decision stand. Also it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long! Rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than the Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The court agreed that this “was one of the worst domestic terrorist attacks since the 9/11 atrocities”. Yet the appellate court tossed out the death sentence. So many lives lost.... https://t.co/s8DJb1LxQW https://t.co/MYOBJcSuLn Astronauts complete first splashdown in 45 years. Very exciting!

The Do Nothing Democrats are more interested in playing politics than in helping our deserving people. DRAIN THE SWAMP ON NOVEMBER 3RD! Pelosi &amp;amp; Schumer blocked desperately needed unemployment payments which is so terrible especially since they fully understand that it was not the workers fault that they are unemployed it’s the fault of China! Pelosi &amp;amp; Schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our Country and our People. All they want is a trillion dollars and much more for their Radical Left Governed States most of which are doing very badly. It is called a BAILOUT for many years of bad Dem Mgmt! .@BillHagertyTN an outstanding man and one of the best Ambassadors ever (Japan) is running an excellent campaign for the Senate.

Big progress being made! https://t.co/8Oeca9H3yq .....Our massive testing capability rather than being praised is used by the Lamestream Media and their partner the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats as a point of scorn. This testing and what we have so quickly done is used as a Fake News weapon. Sad! Somebody please tell Congressman Clyburn who doesn’t have a clue that the chart he put up indicating more CASES for the U.S. than Europe is because we do MUCH MORE testing than any other country in the World.

Support Patio Pizza and its wonderful owner Guy Caligiuri in St. James Long Island (N.Y.). Great Pizza!!! @Varneyco Drug prices will soon be lowered massively. Big Pharma (Drug Companies) are advertising against me like crazy because lower prices mean less profit. When you watch a Fake Ad just think lower drug prices!!! Kate Brown Governor of Oregon isn’t doing her job. She must clear out and in some cases arrest the Anarchists &amp;amp; Agitators in Portland. If she can’t do it the Federal Government will do it for her. We will not be leaving until there is safety! With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting which is good) 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp;amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly securely and safely vote??? Major China Virus flare ups in many of the countries that the Fake News was touting as doing so well. Some of these countries are now a disaster. Lamestream Media doesn’t want to report this. Also highly inaccurate numbers being reported by many other countries!!! @WSJ Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that there’s no accurate count!</td></tr><tr><th>29</th><td>2020-07-29</td><td>Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia.

Votes from many weeks ago are missing - a total mess. They have no idea what is going on. Rigged Election. I told you so. Same thing would happen but on massive scale with USA. Fake News refuses to report! .@FoxNews reported incorrectly what the Federal Government is doing with respect to Portland. We are demanding that the Governor &amp;amp; Mayor do their job or we will do it for them.

After many years the game is finally up for Big Pharma and they’re NOT HAPPY about it! Please understand that when you see their negative ads! The drug companies are spending millions of dollars in advertising against me only because I am lowering drug prices massively 50% and more! Biden and Obama said they would do this for eight years but never did... ...Your housing prices will go up based on the market and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy! I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood...

We did and are doing a GREAT job and have a lot of money left over much more than 2016.... Suburban voters are pouring into the Republican Party because of the violence in Democrat run cities and states. If Biden gets in this violence is “coming to the Suburbs” and FAST.

Maybe the Beauty Parlor owner should be running the House of Representatives instead of Crazy Nancy? Crazy Nancy Pelosi said she was “set up” by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn’t wear a MASK!). Does anyone want a Speaker of the House who can be so easily SET UP? Do you notice that any time Fake News Suppression Polls are put out like @FoxNews the Stock Market goes DOWN.

Look forward to seeing all of my friends! 2016 was AMAZING but we never had this kind of ENTHUSIASM! We had FAR more people (many millions) watching us at the RNC than did Sleepy Joe and the DNC and yet an ad just ran saying the opposite. This is what we’re up against. Lies. But we will WIN! The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in on tape is a really big deal. She probably treats him like she treats everyone else...And she strongly supported a Kennedy who just lost in of all places Massachusetts! Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individual especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule! Crazy Nancy Pelosi is being decimated for having a beauty parlor opened when all others are closed and for not wearing a Mask - despite constantly lecturing everyone else. We will almost certainly take back the House and send Nancy packing! Seriously is this what our great USA wants as its leader? https://t.co/vgYqhuA4BV Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before.

The Radical Left Mayors \\&amp;  Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their “Movement”. It wasn’t supposed to be like this but the Anarchists \\&amp; Agitators got carried away and don’t listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement! I’ve been getting really good polls some over 50\\% except for one Fake Poll done by @ABC NEWS which gives NO INFORMATION about the sample R or D or anything else. They did this last Election with one week to go down 12 points and I won. They are disgusting Fake News! Portland is a mess and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn’t clean it up we will go in and do it for them! If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha Wisconsin there would be no Kenosha right now. Also there would have been great death and injury. I want to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard. I will see you on Tuesday! Just had a wonderful conversation with my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan who will be leaving office soon. Shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan whose relationship with the USA is the best it has ever been. Special man! When is Slow Joe Biden going to criticize the Anarchists Thugs \\&amp; Agitators in ANTIFA? When is he going to suggest bringing up the National Guard in BADLY RUN \\&amp; Crime Infested Democrat Cities \\&amp; States? Remember he can’t lose the Crazy Bernie Super Liberal vote! ....His problem is interesting. He must always be weak on CRIME because of the Bernie Sanders Radical Left voter. If he loses them like Crooked Hillary did he is “toast” and many will vote for me because of TRADE (Bernie was good on trade). Joe MUST always be weak on crime! Joe Biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice his poll numbers are PLUNGING!

It is ready willing and more than able. End problem FAST! 80 Million Unsolicited Ballots are impossible for election centers to tabulate accurately. The Democrats know this better than anyone else. The fraud and abuse will be an embarrassment to our Country. Hopefully the Courts will stop this scam! We again request Kate Brown (@OregonGovBrown) the Governor of Oregon and Mayor @TedWheeler of Portland to call up the National Guard like should have been done 3 months ago... ...They must stop calling these anarchists and agitators “peaceful protestors”. Come back into the real world! The Federal Government is ready to end this problem immediately upon your request. I am pleased to inform the American Public that Acting Secretary Chad Wolf will be nominated to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service! ...More JOBS from Eastport Cutler \\&amp; Jonesport to Stonington Friendship and Casco Bay. I am proud to help the great people of Maine! Beautiful Maine Lobsters will now move tariff-free to Europe! For first time in many years. GREAT new deal by USTR levels playing field with Canada. Millions of \\$’s more in EXPORTS... For our Country to be sending 80 million UNSOLICITED BALLOTS is very unfair and a roadmap to disaster. Even recent small and easier to control elections which did this are a catastrophic disaster. Fraudulent \\&amp; missing Ballots like never seen before. 20\\% and 30\\% off. STOP!

Great! @FoxNews Actually I think I’m leading in the Polls!  @FoxNews @OANN Chris Wallace “forgot” to ask a very weak and pathetic Schumer puppet Senator Chrisie Coons why Biden fought me when I put an extremely early BAN on people coming into our Country from heavily infected China. Biden later admitted I was right! But why no question? “Next we’ll turn to people of the Biden inner circle” said by Chris Wallace of @FoxNews after unsuccessfully GRILLING Mark Meadows. Then all softball questions to a group of Biden lightweights including Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. Important White House News Conference at 5:30 (sharp) today. Very good news! Happy Sunday!

These riots are an antigovernment movement from the Left that are all in Democrat run cities. The mayors have got to let their police do what they know how to do. Would be very easy to suppress or call in the Federal Government. We will solve problem fast! @foxandfriends So now the Democrats are using Mail Drop Boxes which are a voter security disaster. Among other things they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times. Also who controls them are they placed in Republican or Democrat areas? They are not Covid sanitized. A big fraud! Now they’re trying to deny this but they can’t! https://t.co/vNW3I3pPNK .@LouDobbs wrote a great new book “The Trump Century How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever”.

Vote NO to the Pelosi/ Schumer money wasting HOAX which is taking place now. Then fight the \\$51 million unasked for Ballots. Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable! Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY and will not make changes. This is all another HOAX by the Democrats to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes  without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam.... In New Jersey they want you to certify that you asked for the Universal Mail-In Ballot that they sent you. But you never asked for it. Disaster in the wings! Many doctors and studies disagree with this! https://t.co/fpLVJZMvHS The deep state or whoever over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed and saving lives! @SteveFDA Why would Suburban Women vote for Biden and the Democrats when Democrat run cities are now rampant with crime (and they aren’t asking the Federal Government for help) which could easily spread to the suburbs and they will reconstitute on steroids their low income suburbs plan! Biden and the Democrats have greatly disrespected the Great State of Wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to Milwaukee the designated site of the DNC. The State \\&amp; City worked very hard to make sure things would be good. Not nice. Vote Trump Wisconsin! The Democrats took the word GOD out of the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democrat National Convention. At first I thought they made a mistake but it wasn’t. It was done on purpose. Remember Evangelical Christians and ALL this is where they are coming from-it’s done. Vote Nov 3! Another bad night of Rioting in Portland Oregon. A small number of Federal troops there to protect courthouse and other Federal property only (great job!). Wanting to be asked by City \\&amp; State to STOP THE RIOTS.

This should not be allowed! The Democrats are demanding Mail-In Ballots because the enthusiasm meter for Slow Joe Biden is the lowest in recorded history and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote.

Also highly inaccurate numbers being reported by many other countries!!! @WSJ Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that there’s no accurate count! \\\\\n",
       "\t29 & 2020-07-29 & Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What’s that all about? Also Germany is very delinquent in their 2\\% fee to NATO. We are therefore moving some troops out of Germany! Check out this Mail-In Voting experiment by a local news station! https://t.co/23tOdt1hYc New York Mail-In voting is in a disastrous state of condition. Votes from many weeks ago are missing - a total mess. They have no idea what is going on. Rigged Election. I told you so. Same thing would happen but on massive scale with USA. Fake News refuses to report! .@FoxNews reported incorrectly what the Federal Government is doing with respect to Portland. We are demanding that the Governor \\&amp; Mayor do their job or we will do it for them. To complicated to discuss in a Tweet but bad reporting by Fox (possibly on purpose!). @DHSgov Great to be in Texas! https://t.co/6WIUe9lT9D https://t.co/rGwz4N6PwW ...do not stop the Crime and Violence from the Anarchists and Agitators immediately the Federal Government will go in and do the job that local law enforcement was supposed to do! If the Federal Government and its brilliant Law Enforcement (Homeland) didn’t go into Portland one week ago there would be no Portland -- It would be burned and beaten to the ground. If the Mayor and Governor... Just landed in the Great State of Texas! https://t.co/Z9LjIU0Uec I was on Air Force One flying to the Great State of Texas where I just landed. It is AMAZING in watching @FoxNews how different they are from four years ago. Not even watchable. They totally forgot who got them where they are! ...With Biden drug prices will quadruple! After many years the game is finally up for Big Pharma and they’re NOT HAPPY about it! Please understand that when you see their negative ads! The drug companies are spending millions of dollars in advertising against me only because I am lowering drug prices massively 50\\% and more! Biden and Obama said they would do this for eight years but never did... ...Your housing prices will go up based on the market and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy! I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood... If Congress doesn’t bring fairness to Big Tech which they should have done years ago I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it! Reno-Stead Airport has big bucks coming its way. I’m designating over \\$4.8 million from @USDOT to reconstruct the airport’s taxiway and ramp. This along with 4 other airport grants to Nevada will help in the economic recovery and GROWTH of the State! BIG bucks are on their way to @ILMairport. Over \\$21.1 MILLION designated to Wilmington International from @USDOT to expand their terminal and make other major upgrades and safety enhancements. This will help to create JOBS and growth in the region! I am designating \\$18.9 million from @USDOT to MANY airports in Ohio including @goingplacescle @CAKairport and several others for improvements updates and safety. Great for the economy and the people of Ohio! Great news for Florida! \\$3.3 million will be sent to @flyKissimmee from @USDOT for airport improvements and safety enhancements. This is so important for Central Florida and will bring a much-needed boost to the State’s economy! I am designating \\$18.77M from @USDOT for 7 airports across Pennsylvania. @PITairport Northeast Philadelphia Airport Erie International Airport and others around the State. GREAT news for a GREAT State! Texarkana Regional Airport has a major grant coming its way from @USDOT. I’m designating \\$3.6 million to reconstruct its terminal building in addition to 5 more airport grants around the State. Glad to help the people of Arkansas! LAW \\&amp; ORDER! Sleepy Joe Biden is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Left Agenda. He will do whatever they want! “The Plus Self-Help for People Who Hate Self-Help” by the very smart and witty @greggutfeld is on sale now. It is great Canceling Cancel Culture. Make his book as successful as his T.V. Show. Buy it now! Great going to a very talented group! https://t.co/Iyw3yOEoN2 Vote these people out. They are CRAZY!  \\#2020 https://t.co/ktRw2pJUFa \\\\\n",
       "\t30 & 2020-07-28 & RT @WhiteHouse: LIVE: President @realDonaldTrump holds a news conference https://t.co/WDRDU18TYU ....be able to produce what I have. So when you see those nasty ads from Big Pharma remember the only reason they are going all out is the massive PRICE REDUCTIONS you are getting - not good for them. Plus I was only President in 51 years that got a Prescription D reduction! Big Pharma is taking television ads trying to make the case that I am raising prescription drug prices on seniors. The ad is a lie! What I have done will lead to a 50\\% REDUCTION in prices at least \\&amp; Big Pharma is not happy about it. No other President would.... “Nadler calls ANTIFA violence a MYTH.” @foxandfriends  They are Anarchists with miles of “tape” showing their illegal activity. Jerry blame it on Russia Russia Russia! \\\\\n",
